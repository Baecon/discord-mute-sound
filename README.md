**sox troubleshooting instructions**

-Add the Sox folder to your PATH and then restart your terminal.
1. Go to My Computer → Properties → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables → System variables.
2. Select Path.
3. Click Edit → New :
4. Add this: C:\Program Files (x86)\sox-<CHECK YOUR VERSION NUMBER>\
Note

As indicated in the example path, make sure to check what version of Sox you have installed by actually navigating to your Program Files (x86) folder and looking for a folder that starts with sox, for example sox-14-4-2.
Restart your terminal.
Note that if you're using an IDE, you may need to restart the IDE to have the Path variables update.
